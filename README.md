# Assembly-Endgame

The programming-language version of the boring Hangman game. You have eight attempts to guess the 
correct word otherwise all programming languages are eliminated, leaving only assembly language. Poor programmers will have to return to the 1950s when coding was done generally in assembly language ... `MOV` `ADD` `JMP` ... ya know. shit like that. 

## Run the app locally

If you have Node.js, 

1. Clone this repo and cd into the dir:

```bash
# if you have ssh configured
git clone git@github.com:jegrami/assembly-endgame.git

# if you are boring af and use https
git clone https://github.com/jegrami/assembly-endgame.git 

cd assembly-endgame 
```

2. Install dependencies 
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```


That's it. Visit the app at `http://localhost:whatever-port-vite-deems-avaialable-for-you` ... usually `http://localhost:5173`. 

Now you get the chance to not only play the game but also cheat by looking up all the possible words in `words.js.`
